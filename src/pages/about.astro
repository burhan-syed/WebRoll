        WebRoll was heavily inspired by the likes of StumbleUpon and CloudHiker.
        It was created by <a
          class="text-neutral text-opacity-90"
          href="https://github.com/burhan-syed">Burhan Syed</a
        > as an exercise of building with <a
          class="link text-neutral text-opacity-90"
          href="https://astro.build/">AstroJS</a
        > and is open source for anyone interested.
